Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to be uploaded here, so I opted not to include it.
  
The dataset consists of approximately 60% of images taken directly from my garden using my phone's camera,
while the remaining images were downloaded from Google Images and obtained through web scraping.
  
I did not utilize any preexisting dataset; instead, I created my own."
