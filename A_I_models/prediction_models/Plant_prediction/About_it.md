Imagine, your mom asked you for bringing Pudina from market and your mind is blown when you reached to market and can’t distinguish it with Dhania!!! 😶‍🌫️

Or you picked Pudina instead of Kadhi patta (Mithi - Neem) spoiling the taste of curry 🤢

And oh, the horror of mistaking an aloe vera with cactus??🌵 ARGGG… too many spikes to take home

And And… think about someone who his whole life thought that a Money plant 🌱 might actually have currency notes as its leaves. 🤑

How on earth can one survive such traumatic experiences? 😖

Fear not, for there's an ingenious web app with badass technology that swoops in to save the day! 😎

Who needs superhero-vision🦸 when you can rely on this miraculous web app which you can run on your phone too with ease

Just click the photo and upload it here on the link to predict the plant leaves to save you from trouble...



This Image Classification web app is made by me, which comprises Convolutional Neural Network and machine learning. And is trained on about 50% hand clicked images of plants from my pot garden and rest from internet. I trained the model using Convolutional Neural Networks which was a success and can recognize images with an accuracy of around 85%. lastly, I deployed using streamlit.


It can recognise the following plants  –

Neem (Margosa or Murraya koenigii),

Money plant(Pothos or Epipremnum aureum),

Aloe vera( Ghrit-Kumari or Aloe barbadensis miller),

Pudina (Mint Leaves or Mentha spicata) and

Dhania Patti (coriander leaves or Coriandrum sativum)
